# spring-simple-app
The point of this project is to design a small spring app that communicates with a mongodb app, using json to do classic CRUD operations.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matthieusb/spring-simple-app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matthieusb/spring-simple-app)

## Architecture
At first this is just going to be a standalone sprinboot app who answers http requests and uses on a Mongodb database, but the objective is to use microservices (Netflix OSS stack possibly)

## Technologies used
  - API : Spring MVC app (Java) with springboot
  - Persistence : Mongodb NoSQL Database (Document oriented)
  - Front-End : JHipster app with AngularJs 1
