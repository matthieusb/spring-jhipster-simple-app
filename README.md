# spring-simple-app
The point of this app is to design a small spring app that communicates with a mongodb app, using json to do classic CRUD operations.

## Architecture
At first this is just going to be a standalone sprinboot app who answers http requests and uses on a Mongodb database, but the finality is to use microservices (Netflix OSS stack possibly)

## Technologies used
TODO
